## 🔍 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a hybrid document search system—combining TF‑IDF and dense‑vector (FAISS) retrieval + an LLM‑powered summarization pipeline 🤖. It was built for a project manager tasked with cross‑checking hundreds of legislative acts and corporate policy PDFs, previously a manual, time‑intensive process ⏳.

## ✨ Key Benefits
- 🌐 Online via GPT API: Leverage OpenAI’s GPT‑4 for high‑quality summaries with just an API call.
- 🔒 Fully offline option: Download and run Llama‑2/3 or Mistral locally (via llama.cpp) to keep sensitive documents on‑premise.
- ⚡ Faster compliance checks: Instantly retrieve and summarize the most relevant sections across your policy library based on your question/query.
- 🤝 Hybrid search: Balance exact keyword matching (TF‑IDF) with semantic similarity (embeddings + FAISS).
- 🏆 Model comparison with ChatGPT as judge: Automatically have ChatGPT evaluate and rank each model’s summaries, so you can see at a glance which LLM delivers the best results for your cases, designed primarily for scenarios where locally hosted LLMs are preferred.

## 📂 Use Case
A project manager used to spend hours manually scanning dozens of PDF “Acts” against corporate policies. With this tool they can:
- 📥 Ingest an entire folder of PDFs in one step.
- ⚡ Choose online mode (GPT‑4 API) for rapid results, or offline mode (Llama‑2/3/Mistral) for full data privacy.
- ❓ Issue a natural‑language query (e.g., “data privacy exemptions under GDPR”).
- 📄 Receive top‑ranked passages plus concise summaries from each selected model.
- 📤 Export findings for audit reports or stakeholder review.
